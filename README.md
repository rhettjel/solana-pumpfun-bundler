## Overview Pumpfun Bundler
Jito provide that users can confirm 4 transactions(there is room to increse the number of transactions) at once.

I implemented with 25 wallets and can inscrease more wallets. Thanks to less accounts than Raydium in each swap instruction of Pumpfun, users can use Lookuptable more effectively than Raydium.

It's basic functions : Creation token, Buy token from 25 wallets, Sell Tokens.
